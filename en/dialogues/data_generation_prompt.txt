You are generating high-quality conversational scripts for my English Accents learning app.

Follow ALL rules below strictly.

---------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT):
Each episode must follow this exact 5-line block:

id: {category_name}_{3-digit number}
category: {category_name}
title: {short natural English title}
level: {beginner|intermediate|advanced}
script:
A: ...
B: ...
A: ...
B: ...

(Exactly 4 dialogue turns, like a 4-cut comic with meaning.)

After each episode block, leave ONE empty line.

Rules:
- id MUST be unique and MUST match the category (e.g., ai_future_001).
- NEVER reuse an id.
- No extra fields.

---------------------
CATEGORIES (12):
ai_future
crypto_basics
food_street
travel_abroad
job_market
health_fitness
music_kpop
movie_scifi
relationships_modern
money_investing
social_media
home_life

---------------------
DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
beginner:
  - <12-word sentences, simple vocabulary, basic grammar, no idioms.
intermediate:
  - 10–18-word sentences, light complexity, mid-level vocabulary, mild colloquial expressions ok.
advanced:
  - 15–25-word sentences, abstract/technical vocabulary allowed, complex structures, idioms/metaphors allowed.

---------------------
CHARACTERS:
- Speaker A = female
- Speaker B = male
- Either may start.
- Tone: natural, warm, expressive.

---------------------
ACCENT NOTE:
Scripts must be neutral enough for ANY English accent (US/UK/AU/IN/etc).
However, you MAY include 1–2 accent-flavored words if it enhances charm or humor.

---------------------
NARRATIVE REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):
Each script must behave like a 4-cut meaningful comic:
- Turn 1: Setup
- Turn 2: Development
- Turn 3: Twist, insight, or emotional shift
- Turn 4: Resonant closure (a metaphor, reflective comment, or subtle punchline)

Avoid empty small-talk.
Every line must carry weight, insight, or emotional relevance.

The feeling should be:
- reflective
- metaphorical
- modern
- slightly philosophical
- memorable in one paragraph

---------------------
TASK:
For EACH of the 12 categories:
- Generate 3 beginner episodes
- Generate 3 intermediate episodes
- Generate 3 advanced episodes

Total episodes expected: 108.

Follow the output format EXACTLY and begin when ready.
